##  Simulating USDT Transfers Without Blockchain Risk

**Flash USDT Software** enables developers, crypto testers, and escrow platforms to simulate Tether (USDT) transactions in blockchain wallets—without actually transferring tokens on-chain. This licensed tool offers safe, visual USDT balance emulation for TRC20 and ERC20 wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask.

Whether you're testing interfaces, training users, or simulating P2P flows, this software delivers a controlled environment with complete customization.

##  How It Works

1. **Input a wallet address** (TRC20 or ERC20)
2. **Configure simulation details**: USDT amount, visibility settings, duration
3. **Flash USDT balance appears** in the wallet interface
4. **Balance expires** automatically after the license period (24h–365 days)
5. **No blockchain interaction** – zero gas fees, zero risk

The wallet will reflect the USDT as a balance, but the funds are non-transferable and exist only for simulation purposes.
